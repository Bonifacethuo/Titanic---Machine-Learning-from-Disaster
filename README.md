The sinking of the Titanic in 1912 is a tragic event that claimed the lives of over 1,500 passengers and crew. Using data from the Titanic disaster, this project aims to build a predictive model to determine the likelihood of survival based on passenger characteristics such as age, gender, socio-economic class, and embarkation details. By analyzing patterns in the data, the model seeks to identify factors that influenced survival rates. This analysis not only provides insights into historical events but also demonstrates the power of data-driven decision-making through machine learning. The findings can guide future predictive modeling efforts.
